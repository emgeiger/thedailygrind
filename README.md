# The Daily Grind
An open-source coffee grinder accessory. Connected to a Bezzera BB05, although it whould be adaptable to others that use a similar mechanism (stepless adjustment, screw on wheel)

The OLED uses micropython nanoo GUI and a SSD1351 128x128 screen. A stepper motor. A rotary switch and a pi pico.

A very minimal UX centers around a 'DIALLED IN button' that makes it possible to scroll through the last few grinds you were happy with.
